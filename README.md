## 🧠 Problem Statement

With the rapid expansion of online retail platforms, users are often overwhelmed by the multitude of product options. This project aims to build an **E-Commerce Recommendation System** that analyzes user behavior and preferences to suggest the most relevant products, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and boosting business performance.

---

## 💼 Project Overview

- 🔍 **Objective**: Build a recommendation engine using:
  - Content-Based Filtering
  - Collaborative Filtering (Memory-Based / Model-Based)
- 📊 **Dataset**: Includes user-item interaction data like product views, ratings, purchases, and categories.
- 🧰 **Technology Stack**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Surprise, Matplotlib, Streamlit (optional)
- 🎯 **Use Cases**: Personalized shopping suggestions, cross-selling, user engagement improvement, product discovery.

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- ✅ Product recommendation using **cosine similarity** and **user-based k-NN**
- ✅ Matrix factorization using **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)**
- ✅ Clean, modular, and well-documented codebase
- ✅ Comprehensive EDA with insightful visualizations
- ✅ Optional UI using **Streamlit** for interactive usage
