## 🧠 Problem Statement

With the massive growth of online retail, users often get overwhelmed by the number of products available. This project aims to build an **E-Commerce Recommendation System** that understands **user behavior and preferences** to suggest the most relevant products, thereby improving user satisfaction and business sales.

---

## 💼 Project Overview

- 🔍 **Goal**: Build a recommendation engine to suggest products using:
  - Content-Based Filtering
  - Collaborative Filtering (Memory-Based / Model-Based)
- 📊 **Dataset**: Includes user-item interaction data like product views, ratings, purchases, and categories.
- 🔧 **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Surprise, Matplotlib, Streamlit (optional for frontend)
- 🎯 **Applications**: Personalized shopping platforms, ad targeting, inventory management, user engagement.

---

## 🧩 Features

- ✅ Product recommendation using **cosine similarity** and **user-based k-NN**
- ✅ Matrix factorization using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**
- ✅ Clean and modular code structure
- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
- ✅ Optional UI using **Streamlit** for real-time recommendations
